Problem
Create a project in .NetCore, with api's rest to attend the registration of customers. For this we would like to propose the following:
Project using DDD
Code first - Using entity framework
Domain creation, thinking about the rules that the domain may have
API rest - CRUD
Business rules:
The same customer cannot be registered twice.
The customer must be composed with the following information:
- Nome Completo (Full name)
- Data de Nascimento (Date of Birth)
- Documentos (RG/CPF) (Documents (RG/CPF))
- Endere√ßo (Address)
- Data do cadastro (Date of registration)
- Cliente ativo (Active customer)
